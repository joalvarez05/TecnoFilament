# TecnoFilament
This repository contains the code for a website dedicated to 3D printing filaments.

On this static website, I worked with both custom CSS and Bootstrap. I set up an image carousel, created cards with images and product descriptions, and designed grid layouts with Bootstrap to showcase all the available products. Thereâ€™s also a pagination system. The footer was made using Bootstrap's grid system as well. On the second page, I created 4 cards using grids and a table with product features. Finally, the contact page uses Flexbox and includes a contact form with all the necessary validations, following RFC 5322. The whole site is responsive.
